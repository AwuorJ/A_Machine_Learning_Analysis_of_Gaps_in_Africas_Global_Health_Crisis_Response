**Machine Learning Predictions of H1N1 and Seasonal Vaccination Uptake**

Back in June 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared influenza a global pandemic. This was just was two months after its first outbreak in North America. At the time of its pandemic status declaration, a total of 74 coutries had already reported their first case of the A(H1N1) virus infection. The virus caused respiratory complications leading to about 284, 500 deaths globally, which was an estimate of about 0.007% of the world's population. As a prevention mechanism to counter further infections, the H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccines were developed and availed to the public in October 2009.

**Problem Statement:**

This project aims to predict the probability frequencies of H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccine administration, using data collected in the National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey. These predictions will be crucial for guiding the health sector on future vaccination startegies to implement in the face of pandemic and/or epidemic outbreaks.

**Objectives:**

    1. Predict the probabilities of receiving H1N1 flu vaccine.

    2. Predict the probabilities of receiving seasonal flu vaccine.

**Methodology:**

    1. Logistic Regression: To predict the h1n1 vaccine.

    2. Decision Tree: To predict the seasonal_vaccine to accomodate the bimodal distribution nature of its data.

**Findings:**

On average, the predicted probability of receiving the H1N1 vaccine is 0.1932, while the probability of receiving the seasonal flu vaccine is 0.47704.
